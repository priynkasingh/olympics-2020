Data Exploration &amp; Visualisation based on Tokyo 2020 Olympics
This project is based on data from Tokyo Olympics 2020 available at Kaggle {https://www.kaggle.com/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo}. 
I have used Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for visualization purposes.


For viewing the curves it is suggested to download the HTML file and view it in your browser. You can also view the ipython notebook at https://www.kaggle.com/priynka88/olympics-2020-eda.
